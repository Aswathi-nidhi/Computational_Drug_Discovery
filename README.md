Here i have collected the datasets to predict the bioactivity data using python implemented machine learning.

Steps:

Data Collection:

Gathered bioactivity data for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors from public databases such as ChEMBL.

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and normalized the data.
Converted molecular structures to numerical representations using cheminformatics tools.

Model Building:

Developed machine learning models to predict bioactivity.
Used algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE, RÂ², and accuracy.
Conducted cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Prediction:

Used the best-performing model to predict the bioactivity of new compounds.
